## Machine-Learning Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

As part of a **four-intern team**, I helped design and deploy a machine-learning–driven ingestion pipeline that streams **10 000+ customer reviews** into the company’s cloud environment each month.

### Key Contributions
- **Data Ingestion & Processing**  
  Built and productionized a pipeline that ingests third-party contractor data, performs sentiment analysis, and generates correlation reports in real time.
- **Insightful Dashboards**  
  Developed an interactive dashboard that enables district and store managers to explore customer sentiment and feedback at a glance.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**  
  Met regularly with business users to refine requirements and delivered concise progress updates to key stakeholders to keep the project tightly aligned with organizational goals.
