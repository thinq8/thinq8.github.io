## Enterprise Database Authentication Overhaul

I **spearheaded the end-to-end migration** of our enterprise cloud-data platform from legacy **Basic Auth** to an **asymmetric key-pair model**, hardening security while ensuring zero-downtime continuity for all data-ingestion jobs.

### Key Contributions
- **Authentication Modernization**  
  - Implemented public/private key infrastructure with automatic key rotation, eliminating shared passwords and satisfying SOC 2 & HIPAA control requirements.  
  - Refactored 1 000+ Talend/Snowflake jobs through manual and scripted bulk updates and CI pipelines.
- **Hardened Ingestion Pipelines**  
  - Used real-time anomaly-detection hooks that flag credential misuse and throttle suspicious traffic.
- **Seamless Rollout & Governance**  
  - Devised an automated rollback playbook, achieving a **100 % success rate** across five production waves.  
  - Conducted workshops for DevOps and data-engineering teams, raising security-incident response readiness.
